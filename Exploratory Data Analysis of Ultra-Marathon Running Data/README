# Ultra-Marathon Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores ultra-marathon running data to answer key performance-related questions using Python. 

## Key Insights
- Male and female athletes show differing speeds in 50K and 50-mile races.
- Age significantly impacts performance, with peak and suboptimal ranges.
- Seasonal variations affect running times.

## Code Snippets
### Filtering and Cleaning Data
```python
# Combine filters for USA, 50K, and 50 miles races
filtered_data = data[(data['distance'].isin(['50K', '50mi'])) & (data['country'] == 'USA')]
